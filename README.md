Guys you are amazing!! thanks for making this possible. Find below the 3 projects that were presented:

## 1. Attending the Demand
[Github](https://github.com/jpchamps/attending_demand_sismo)

Mexicans affected by the earthquake have received outstanding support from the community. The social networks have been spectators of a tremendous amount of matches between supply and demand of support, making the situation way more efficient than 1985 earthquake. Nonetheless, the lack of a tool that centralizes the demand in real time, is making it hard for support providers, and may also be leaving unattended demand, particularly from people with less visibility.

### Objectives of the project:

1. Download data from social networks and the web in general to assess whether the demand of support is being attended properly. 
2. Identify the categories with more unattended cases (see categories below).
3. Identify the tools that have already been created to attend these issues.
4. Create a database with unattended cases and attend them through a Twitter/Facebook account by providing potential support suppliers (in many cases suppliers will be existing tools). Opened cases will be closed until we have confirmation from the users that their demand has been attended. 
5. If the existing tools are lacking key features, try to talk with the owners about this, or develop tools that include these features if needed.
